# Category Order Persistence Solution

This solution prevents category order from changing when modifying sub criteria after dragging. The problem occurs when:

1. Categories are reordered by dragging
2. When sub criteria are modified, the component re-renders and loses the custom order
3. The categories revert to their original order

## Solution Components

### 1. `useCategoryOrder` Hook (`hooks/useCategoryOrder.ts`)

A custom React hook that manages category order persistence:

- **Persistent Storage**: Uses localStorage to save category order
- **Order Restoration**: Automatically restores saved order on component mount
- **New Category Handling**: Handles new categories added to the list
- **State Management**: Provides methods for reordering, updating, and managing categories

### 2. `CategoryManager` Component (`CategoryManager.tsx`)

A drag-and-drop enabled component that:

- Uses `react-beautiful-dnd` for drag and drop functionality
- Integrates with the `useCategoryOrder` hook
- Provides UI for adding/removing sub criteria
- Maintains category order during sub criteria modifications

### 3. `CategoryDemo` Component (`CategoryDemo.tsx`)

A demo component showing how to use the CategoryManager:

- Example categories with sub criteria
- Real-time order display
- Feature documentation

## Key Features

### ✅ Persistent Category Order
- Category order is saved to localStorage
- Order persists across page refreshes
- Order is maintained when modifying sub criteria

### ✅ Drag and Drop Reordering
- Visual drag handle (⋮⋮) for intuitive reordering
- Smooth drag animations with visual feedback
- Proper drop zone handling

### ✅ Sub Criteria Management
- Add new sub criteria to any category
- Remove existing sub criteria
- Edit sub criteria names and descriptions
- Changes don't affect category order

### ✅ State Management
- Proper React state management with useCallback
- Optimized re-renders
- Clean separation of concerns

## Usage

```tsx
import CategoryManager from './CategoryManager';

function MyComponent() {
  const [categories, setCategories] = useState(initialCategories);

  return (
    <CategoryManager 
      categories={categories} 
      onCategoriesChange={setCategories} 
    />
  );
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: On component mount, the hook checks localStorage for saved category order
2. **Order Restoration**: If saved order exists, categories are reordered accordingly
3. **New Categories**: Any new categories not in the saved order are appended
4. **Drag Handling**: When categories are dragged, the new order is saved to localStorage
5. **Sub Criteria Updates**: When sub criteria are modified, only the specific category is updated, preserving the overall order

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React's useState and useEffect for state management
- Implements useCallback for performance optimization
- Maintains separate state for categories and category order

### Persistence Strategy
- Stores category order as JSON array in localStorage
- Key: `'categoryOrder'`
- Value: Array of category IDs in order

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handles missing localStorage
- Handles invalid saved data
- Provides fallback to default order

## Browser Compatibility

- Requires localStorage support
- Uses react-beautiful-dnd for drag and drop
- Compatible with modern browsers

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized re-renders with useCallback
- Minimal localStorage writes
- Efficient state updates
- Clean component separation

## Troubleshooting

### Category Order Not Persisting
- Check if localStorage is available
- Verify the `categoryOrder` key in localStorage
- Ensure the hook is properly initialized

### Drag and Drop Not Working
- Verify react-beautiful-dnd is installed
- Check for proper DragDropContext setup
- Ensure draggable elements have unique IDs

### Sub Criteria Changes Affecting Order
- Verify the useCategoryOrder hook is being used
- Check that updateSubCriteria is called correctly
- Ensure category order state is separate from sub criteria state
